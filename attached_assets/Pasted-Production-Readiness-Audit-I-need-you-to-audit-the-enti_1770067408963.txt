Production Readiness Audit
I need you to audit the entire LobsterSandbox codebase for production readiness. Go through every feature and tell me what's REAL (actually works) vs FAKE (placeholder/mock/UI-only).

Check each of these and report back with status:

CATEGORY 1: SAFETY CONTROLS
- Kill Switch button: Does clicking it actually stop an OpenClaw process, or is it just UI?
- Wipe Everything button: Does it actually delete files/data, or is it just UI?
- Safe Mode toggle: Does it actually change OpenClaw config, or is it just a setting stored in our DB?

CATEGORY 2: OPENCLAW INTEGRATION
- Is there any code that actually spawns, connects to, or communicates with an OpenClaw gateway?
- Is there an OpenClaw process running as part of this Replit, or is LobsterSandbox standalone?
- Does the Status Dashboard actually check a real OpenClaw gateway, or is it mock data?
- Does the Channel Status (WhatsApp/Discord/Telegram dots) check real connections?

CATEGORY 3: API COST TRACKING
- Is there a proxy that intercepts API calls and logs token usage?
- Is the cost data in the nav widget coming from real API call logs, or is it mock/hardcoded?
- Does the budget alert system actually trigger, or is it just UI?
- Does auto-pause at budget limit actually work?

CATEGORY 4: PAYMENTS
- Is Stripe connected? Are there any Stripe API calls or webhook handlers?
- Do the pricing page buttons go to real Stripe Checkout, or are they just links to /setup?
- Is there a subscription status check that gates Pro features?
- Is config export actually gated behind Pro, or does everyone get it?

CATEGORY 5: DEPLOY BUTTONS
- Are the deploy button URLs real templates, or placeholder "#" links?
- Is there a Replit template set up for forking?

CATEGORY 6: DATA & AUTH
- What database is being used? (SQLite? Replit DB? PostgreSQL?)
- Is user auth real and secure? (password hashing, session management)
- Is the sandbox counter (/api/sandbox-count) persistent across restarts?
- Is feedback storage (/api/feedback) persistent?

CATEGORY 7: ENVIRONMENT & CONFIG
- What environment variables are required? List them all.
- Are there any hardcoded secrets or API keys in the code?
- Is there a .env.example file documenting required config?

Be brutally honest. I need to know exactly what work remains before this is production-ready.
