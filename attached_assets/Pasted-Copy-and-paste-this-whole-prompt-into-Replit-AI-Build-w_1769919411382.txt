```text
You are building a production quality Replit project called LobsterSandbox.

PRODUCT
LobsterSandbox is a simple “safe sandbox launcher” for OpenClaw. Non technical users should be able to set up OpenClaw in minutes from a clean web wizard, then use the OpenClaw Control UI inside the same app.

Key promise:
Try OpenClaw without touching your real accounts on day 1. Safe defaults, easy reset, kill switch.

SCOPE
This is v1. Do NOT provision external VPS instances. The goal is to run the OpenClaw gateway inside the Replit environment and expose it safely through a reverse proxy route. This makes it a sandbox demo and a template users can fork.

STACK
- Node.js 22
- Express
- Server rendered HTML with Tailwind CSS via CDN, no build pipeline
- http-proxy-middleware (or node-http-proxy) for reverse proxy with WebSocket support
- child_process.spawn to run OpenClaw CLI
- Store state in ./data and never print secrets in logs
- No database for v1

IMPORTANT SECURITY RULES
- The OpenClaw gateway must bind to loopback only.
- The gateway must require token auth.
- Never expose the raw gateway port publicly. Only access it through the Express reverse proxy.
- Do not auto create Gmail accounts, phone numbers, or anything that can be used for abuse. The product is “safe sandbox and setup”, not “identity creation”.
- Mask API keys in any UI output. Never echo the full key back.

USER EXPERIENCE
Landing page is super simple and friendly:
Title: LobsterSandbox
Subtitle: Launch OpenClaw in a safe sandbox in minutes.
Two buttons:
1) Open Setup
2) Open Control UI

Pages:
1) GET /
2) GET /setup
   - Password gate using SETUP_PASSWORD
   - After login show a 3 step wizard:
     Step 1: Choose provider: OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter
     Step 2: Paste API key
     Step 3: Choose model (preset dropdown + custom text)
       Presets:
       - OpenAI: openai/gpt-5.2
       - Anthropic: anthropic/claude-opus-4-5
       - OpenRouter: openrouter/auto
   - Primary CTA: “Run Setup”
   - Secondary CTA: “Start Gateway”
   - Danger zone: “Kill Switch”, “Wipe Everything”
3) GET /status
   - Shows:
     - Setup complete yes/no
     - Gateway running yes/no
     - Health status (openclaw health)
     - Last 200 log lines (with secrets masked)
     - Buttons: Run Quick Verify, Run Security Audit, Run Security Fix
4) /openclaw
   - Reverse proxy to the OpenClaw Control UI running at http://127.0.0.1:18789
   - Must support WebSockets (upgrade headers)
   - All subpaths under /openclaw/* must proxy correctly
   - Add a small top bar on /openclaw that links back to /status

ROUTING AND COMMANDS
Use these environment variables:
- PORT (provided by Replit)
- SETUP_PASSWORD (required)
- OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN (required, long random string)
- OPENCLAW_PORT default 18789 (allow override)
- OPENCLAW_BIND default loopback
- OPENCLAW_HOME = ./data/home (use as HOME for OpenClaw processes)
- OPENCLAW_LOG = ./data/logs/openclaw.log

OpenClaw installation:
- Add openclaw as an npm dependency in package.json so the CLI is available.
- Provide a helper that resolves the CLI path: ./node_modules/.bin/openclaw
- On server startup, run “openclaw --version” to confirm it exists and show version on /status

Onboarding (non interactive):
- Always force local mode, loopback bind, gateway port, and token auth.
- Always set HOME to OPENCLAW_HOME for the process so all config lives under ./data/home.

When user clicks “Run Setup”, run:
For OpenAI:
openclaw onboard --non-interactive --mode local --flow quickstart --auth-choice openai-api-key --openai-api-key <KEY> --gateway-port <PORT> --gateway-bind loopback --gateway-auth token --gateway-token <OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN> --skip-skills

For Anthropic:
openclaw onboard --non-interactive --mode local --flow quickstart --auth-choice apiKey --anthropic-api-key <KEY> --gateway-port <PORT> --gateway-bind loopback --gateway-auth token --gateway-token <OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN> --skip-skills

For OpenRouter:
openclaw onboard --non-interactive --mode local --flow quickstart --auth-choice openrouter-api-key --openrouter-api-key <KEY> --gateway-port <PORT> --gateway-bind loopback --gateway-auth token --gateway-token <OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN> --skip-skills

After onboarding, set the default model:
- Write a minimal config patch if needed so the primary model becomes the chosen model.
- Prefer using an OpenClaw CLI config command if available, otherwise edit the config JSON safely.

Gateway process:
- Start it with:
openclaw gateway --port <PORT> --bind loopback --auth token --token <OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN> --verbose
- Keep a single running gateway process in memory. Prevent duplicate starts.
- “Kill switch” must terminate the gateway process cleanly.
- If gateway is not configured yet, show a clear message and disable /openclaw.

Reset and safety tools:
- Wipe Everything button must:
  - stop gateway
  - run: openclaw reset --scope full --yes --non-interactive
  - delete ./data/home and ./data/logs
- Quick Verify must run:
  - openclaw status
  - openclaw health
  - openclaw security audit --deep
- Security Audit button runs: openclaw security audit --deep
- Security Fix button runs: openclaw security audit --fix

LOGGING
- Log all stdout and stderr from OpenClaw commands to OPENCLAW_LOG
- Show last 200 lines on /status
- Implement a masking function that redacts:
  - the provider key the user entered
  - OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN
  - any strings that look like API keys (basic patterns)

REVERSE PROXY REQUIREMENTS
- Implement /openclaw and /openclaw/* proxy to http://127.0.0.1:<OPENCLAW_PORT>
- WebSockets must work
- Preserve headers needed for WS and cookies
- Add basic security headers for the Express app

RATE LIMITING
- Add rate limit for /setup login and /setup/run

FILES
Create:
- server.js (Express app)
- lib/openclaw.js (helpers: runCommand, isConfigured, startGateway, stopGateway, audit, reset)
- views/ (simple HTML templates)
- README.md with:
  - what LobsterSandbox does
  - setup steps in Replit
  - which secrets to set
  - how to open /setup, /status, /openclaw
  - troubleshooting section

DEFINITION OF DONE
- I can run the Replit app, set SETUP_PASSWORD and OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN, open /setup, choose provider, paste key, click Run Setup, then click Open Control UI and see the OpenClaw dashboard through /openclaw.
- /status shows health and logs.
- Kill switch and wipe work.
- WebSockets work through the proxy.

Make the UI minimal and clean with LobsterSandbox branding and a short safety warning on the setup page: “Start with a sandbox mindset. Do not connect your main accounts on day 1.”
```

After Replit generates it, do this:

1. In Replit, add Secrets
   SETUP_PASSWORD = your password
   OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN = a long random token
   Optional: OPENCLAW_PORT = 18789

2. Click Run

3. Open these routes
   `/setup` to configure provider
   `/status` to verify health and run security audit
   `/openclaw` to use the Control UI
