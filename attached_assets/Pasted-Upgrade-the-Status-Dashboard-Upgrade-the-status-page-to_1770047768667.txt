Upgrade the Status Dashboard
Upgrade the /status page to be a full operational dashboard with cards showing all key sandbox metrics.

Replace the current status page content with this card-based layout:

PAGE HEADER:
Title: "📊 Sandbox Dashboard"
Subtitle: "Everything happening in your sandbox at a glance."

ROW 1 — Three summary cards side by side (stack on mobile):

Card 1: "Gateway Status"
- Large status indicator: green dot + "Running" or red dot + "Stopped"
- Uptime: "Up since [timestamp]" or "Currently stopped"
- OpenClaw version number (read from gateway health endpoint if available, otherwise show "Not connected")
- Small text: "Gateway binds to loopback only ✅"
- If gateway is not running, show a "Start Gateway" hint or link to /setup

Card 2: "Budget Tracker"
- Large text: "$X.XX / $XX.00" showing current spend vs limit
- Visual progress bar below (green 0-50%, yellow 50-80%, red 80-100%)
- Smaller text: "Today: $X.XX"
- Link: "Change budget →" goes to settings or setup
- If no budget is set: show "No budget configured" with link to set one

Card 3: "Safety Status"
- Current mode with icon: "🟢 Safe Mode" or "🟡 Power Mode"
- Kill Switch status: "Ready" (green) or "Triggered" (red)
- Last wipe: show date or "Never wiped"
- Session info: "Idle timeout: 30 min / Max: 8 hours"

ROW 2 — Two cards side by side (stack on mobile):

Card 4: "Connected Channels" (left half)
- List each connected channel with a status dot:
  - Green dot = connected and active
  - Gray dot = configured but disconnected
  - Example: "🟢 WebChat" / "🟢 Discord" / "⚪ WhatsApp (not configured)"
- If nothing is connected yet: "No external channels connected. WebChat is available in the Control UI."
- Small link: "Manage channels in Control UI →" links to /openclaw

Card 5: "Recent Activity" (right half)
- Last 10 messages or actions, most recent first
- Each entry shows: timestamp, brief message preview (truncated to ~50 chars), channel it came from, estimated cost
- Example row: "2:34 PM — 'Research the latest news about...' — WebChat — ~$0.03"
- If no activity yet: "No activity yet. Open the Control UI and start chatting!"
- Small link: "Open Control UI →" links to /openclaw

ROW 3 — Full width card:

Card 6: "API Usage This Week"
- Simple bar chart showing estimated daily spend for the last 7 days
- X-axis: day names (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun)
- Y-axis: dollar amount
- Below the chart, a summary table:
  | Date | Requests | Est. Input Tokens | Est. Output Tokens | Est. Cost |
  | Today | 12 | 8,400 | 3,200 | $0.87 |
  | Yesterday | 28 | 19,600 | 7,800 | $2.14 |
  | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
  | Total | 40 | 28,000 | 11,000 | $3.01 |
- If no usage data exists yet, show an empty chart with: "No API usage recorded yet. Start chatting to see your usage here."

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Cards should have subtle shadows or borders, white background, rounded corners
- Use the LobsterSandbox theme colors consistently
- Auto-refresh the dashboard every 30 seconds (add a small "Last updated: X seconds ago" indicator at the top right)
- All data should gracefully handle empty/zero states — show helpful messages instead of blank cards
- The bar chart can be built with a simple CSS bar chart or a lightweight JS chart library — nothing heavy
- Fully responsive: cards stack vertically on mobile, table scrolls horizontally if needed
- Keep the nav bar, Kill Switch, Wipe, Larry chatbot, and footer consistent with all other pages

Make sure all existing tests still pass.
