Update the existing LobsterSandbox project to v1.1.

CONTEXT
This project currently wraps OpenClaw with:
- provider key wizard
- channel configuration UI
- mascot guidance
- OpenClaw Control UI access

GOAL
Reframe the product from “setup wizard” to “Safe Sandbox playbook” and implement v1.1 UX improvements without breaking existing OpenClaw integration.

HIGH LEVEL CHANGES
A) Add Safety Profile Selector
B) Make Kill Switch and Wipe always visible
C) Add Sandbox Playbook inside the app
D) Reorder the hero: safety first, channels second
E) Add Remote Access Hardening guidance section

A) SAFETY PROFILE SELECTOR
- Add route /profile
- Two options:
  1) Safe Mode (default)
  2) Power Mode
- Persist selection in ./data/profile.json
- Add middleware: if setup is complete but profile is not chosen, redirect to /profile
- Safe Mode behavior:
  - Control UI is allowed
  - Channels UI is hidden or disabled by default
  - Show a button “Enable channels” with a warning and confirmation
- Power Mode behavior:
  - Channels UI enabled

B) PERSISTENT SAFETY BAR
- Add a small top bar visible on every page, including /openclaw wrapper:
  - Status link
  - Kill Switch button
  - Wipe Everything button
- Kill Switch stops the gateway process and updates status immediately
- Wipe Everything:
  - confirmation step
  - stop gateway
  - reset OpenClaw state as the project currently supports
  - delete app state under ./data as appropriate
  - redirect to /profile when done
- Ensure secrets are never printed or shown in full

C) SANDBOX PLAYBOOK SECTION
Add a “Sandbox Playbook” section to /setup and /status with 3 cards and checkboxes:
1) Email
   - Use a secondary inbox you control
   - Or create a new inbox manually
   - Or use a workspace domain you own
2) Phone
   - Use a second number via eSIM or spare device
   - WhatsApp Business with a separate number
3) Billing
   - Use a separate card with a low limit
   - Set a small monthly budget
   - Use Kill Switch if anything looks off
Copy must be plain English, non technical, and emphasize “do not connect your main accounts on day 1”.

D) LANDING PAGE AND FLOW REORDER
Update home page:
- Headline: “LobsterSandbox”
- Subheadline: “Run OpenClaw in a safe sandbox. Safe Mode by default.”
- 3 bullets:
  - Safe Mode on by default
  - Kill switch and wipe
  - Guided separation playbook
- Primary buttons:
  - Start Setup
  - Open Control UI
  - View Status
- De emphasize channels on the landing page

Update setup flow order:
- Setup wizard
- Profile selector
- Status
- Control UI
Channels should not be the first thing users see.

E) REMOTE ACCESS HARDENING GUIDANCE
Add a section called “Remote access (optional)” on /status:
- Recommended: Tailscale
- Advanced: Cloudflare Tunnel
Include warnings:
- do not open ports directly
- keep token auth
- use allowlists

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Use existing file structure and patterns already in the repo
- Find current routes and templates and modify them, do not rewrite the whole app
- Preserve existing OpenClaw start/stop/reset logic and just hook it into the new buttons
- Add masking for logs and any key display, never show full secrets
- If the project already has a mascot, update its guidance text to match the new safety first positioning

ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST
- After setup completes, user is forced to choose Safe Mode or Power Mode
- Safe Mode hides or disables channels until user explicitly enables them
- Kill Switch and Wipe visible on every page and work
- Sandbox Playbook visible in app, not just README
- Landing page talks about safety first, not channels
- Control UI still loads and works as before
