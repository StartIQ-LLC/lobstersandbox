he Comparison Page. This is important because it directly answers "why not just use OpenClaw's built-in sandbox or DigitalOcean 1-click?" which is the first question any technical person will ask:
PROMPT 3: Comparison Page
Create a new page at /compare called "LobsterSandbox vs. Other Options"

PAGE HEADER:
Title: "Why LobsterSandbox?"
Subtitle: "There are many ways to run OpenClaw. Here's how LobsterSandbox compares."

SECTION 1 — Comparison table with these columns:
- Feature (row label)
- LobsterSandbox
- OpenClaw Direct Install
- DigitalOcean 1-Click
- Docker Self-Host

Make it a clean, responsive table. On mobile, allow horizontal scroll or convert to stacked cards.

Rows:

Row 1: "Technical knowledge needed"
- LobsterSandbox: "None — guided wizard" ✅
- OpenClaw Direct: "Node.js, CLI, terminal" ❌
- DigitalOcean: "SSH, server admin" ❌
- Docker: "Docker, Compose, CLI" ❌

Row 2: "Account separation guidance"
- LobsterSandbox: "Built-in Burner Stack Guide" ✅
- OpenClaw Direct: "Not included" ❌
- DigitalOcean: "Not included" ❌
- Docker: "Not included" ❌

Row 3: "Kill Switch"
- LobsterSandbox: "Always visible, one click" ✅
- OpenClaw Direct: "Manual process stop" ⚠️
- DigitalOcean: "Destroy droplet" ⚠️
- Docker: "docker stop command" ⚠️

Row 4: "Full environment wipe"
- LobsterSandbox: "One click + confirmation" ✅
- OpenClaw Direct: "Delete ~/.openclaw/ manually" ⚠️
- DigitalOcean: "Destroy and rebuild droplet" ⚠️
- Docker: "Remove container + volumes" ⚠️

Row 5: "Safe Mode by default"
- LobsterSandbox: "Yes — agent asks before acting" ✅
- OpenClaw Direct: "Must configure manually" ❌
- DigitalOcean: "Must configure manually" ❌
- Docker: "Must configure manually" ❌

Row 6: "API cost controls"
- LobsterSandbox: "Budget caps coming soon" 🔜
- OpenClaw Direct: "Not included" ❌
- DigitalOcean: "Not included" ❌
- Docker: "Not included" ❌

Row 7: "Time to first chat"
- LobsterSandbox: "Under 5 minutes" ✅
- OpenClaw Direct: "30-60 minutes" ❌
- DigitalOcean: "15-20 minutes" ⚠️
- Docker: "20-30 minutes" ⚠️

Row 8: "Cost"
- LobsterSandbox: "Free tier available"
- OpenClaw Direct: "Free + API costs"
- DigitalOcean: "$24/mo + API costs"
- Docker: "Free + hosting + API costs"

Use green background tint for ✅ cells, yellow for ⚠️, red for ❌, and blue for 🔜. Make the LobsterSandbox column slightly highlighted (subtle background) so it stands out.

SECTION 2 — Below the table, add an important positioning statement:

Title: "We're not replacing these tools — we're the on-ramp"
Text: "LobsterSandbox doesn't host OpenClaw infrastructure. We guide you through safe setup and wrap it with safety controls. Once you're comfortable, you can graduate to a full production setup on your own hardware or any cloud provider. Think of us as the training wheels that make the scary part easy."

CTA button: "🚀 Start Your Safe Setup" → /setup

SECTION 3 — Add a link to /compare from the homepage. Put it in the "What is LobsterSandbox?" section at the bottom as an additional link: "📊 See how we compare" → /compare

Also add /compare to the footer navigation if there is one.

Keep the nav bar, Kill Switch, Wipe button, Larry chatbot, and footer consistent with all other pages.
This page is critical for credibility. When someone shares LobsterSandbox on Hacker News or Twitter, the first response will be "why not just use Docker?" — this page answers that before they even ask.
