Share & Viral Mechanics
Add sharing and viral mechanics across the site. This is about making LobsterSandbox easy to share and giving users reasons to spread the word.

PART 1 — SHARE MODAL COMPONENT (reusable)

Create a reusable share modal that can be triggered from anywhere. When opened, it shows:

Title: "Share LobsterSandbox"
Subtitle: "Help someone else try OpenClaw safely."

Share buttons row:
- "Copy Link" button (copies https://lobstersandbox.com to clipboard, shows "Copied! ✅" for 2 seconds)
- "𝕏 Twitter/X" button (opens new tab: https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%27m%20testing%20OpenClaw%20without%20risking%20my%20real%20accounts%20using%20LobsterSandbox%20%F0%9F%A6%9E&url=https://lobstersandbox.com )
- "LinkedIn" button (opens new tab: https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https://lobstersandbox.com )
- "Reddit" button (opens new tab: https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://lobstersandbox.com&title=LobsterSandbox%20-%20Try%20OpenClaw%20without%20risking%20your%20real%20accounts )

Below the buttons, a text box with a pre-written message they can copy:
"I'm testing OpenClaw without risking my real accounts. LobsterSandbox gives you throwaway account setup, API cost controls, and a Kill Switch. 🦞 https://lobstersandbox.com"

The modal should close on clicking outside, clicking X, or pressing Escape.

PART 2 — SHARE TRIGGERS

Add share buttons/prompts in these locations:

Location 1 — Homepage hero section:
After the two main CTAs ("Launch Your Sandbox" and "Read the Burner Stack Guide"), add a smaller tertiary link: "📤 Share with a friend" → opens share modal

Location 2 — Burner Stack Guide completion:
When all 4 checkboxes are checked and the "Your Burner Stack is Ready!" section appears, add below the CTA:
"Know someone who's scared of OpenClaw? Share the guide."
Button: "📤 Share the Guide" → opens share modal (but with URL set to https://lobstersandbox.com/guide)

Location 3 — Mission completion celebrations:
When a user marks ANY mission as complete and the Larry celebration toast appears, add to the toast:
"Share your progress → 📤" (small clickable link in the toast that opens share modal)

Location 4 — After completing ALL 6 missions:
Show a completion banner at the top of the missions page:
"🏆 All Missions Complete! You've mastered the sandbox."
"Share your achievement: 📤" → opens share modal with text: "I just completed all 6 LobsterSandbox missions — from first chat to building custom skills. Ready to try OpenClaw safely? 🦞 https://lobstersandbox.com/missions"

PART 3 — COMMUNITY COUNTER (social proof)

Add a counter to the homepage, below the hero section trust icons but above the "Built for People Like You" quotes:

Display: "🦞 [NUMBER] sandboxes launched"

For now, since we don't have real analytics, start the counter at 127 and increment it by 1 every time someone completes the setup wizard (store count in the database or a JSON file on the server). The counter should be fetched from an API endpoint: GET /api/sandbox-count

Style: centered, large number, subtle animation (count up on page load from 0 to the current number over ~1 second). Muted descriptive text below or beside the number.

PART 4 — FOOTER SHARE

In the site footer, add a small section:
"Built by lobster lovers for the OpenClaw community. 📤 Share LobsterSandbox"
The "Share LobsterSandbox" text opens the share modal.

DESIGN:
- Share modal should feel lightweight and fast — not heavy or intrusive
- Share buttons should use recognizable platform colors (X/Twitter black, LinkedIn blue, Reddit orange)
- The community counter should feel organic, not aggressive
- Share prompts at completion moments should feel celebratory, not pushy — users just accomplished something, sharing feels natural
- All share links open in new tabs
- Mobile: share modal takes full width with some padding, buttons stack if needed
- All existing tests should pass. Add tests for: share modal renders, /api/sandbox-count endpoint returns a number, counter displays on homepage.
