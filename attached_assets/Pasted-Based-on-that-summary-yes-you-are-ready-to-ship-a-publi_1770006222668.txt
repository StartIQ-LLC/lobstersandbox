Based on that summary, yes, you are ready to ship a public beta.

What you have now hits the core promise: safe defaults, reversible, guided, and it actually works end to end.

Here is the only “go live” checklist I would run before you flip the switch.

## Must do before launch

1. HTTPS everywhere
   Redirect HTTP to HTTPS, enable HSTS, and confirm cookies are marked Secure.

2. Cookie and session hardening
   HttpOnly, SameSite, short idle timeout, and a firm max lifetime.

3. Security headers
   CSP, frame protection, referrer policy, and no sniff. Helmet can do most of it, but make sure the proxied Control UI still works.

4. Confirm no auth bypass on /openclaw
   Double check these paths are protected:

* /openclaw
* /openclaw/*
* WebSocket upgrade requests

5. Confirm secrets never touch disk
   Provider keys should never be written into ./data or logs. If anything must persist, persist only non sensitive config.

6. Rate limits on the scary endpoints
   You already rate limit login. Also rate limit:

* setup run
* start gateway
* wipe
* security audit

7. Process supervision and log rotation
   Use a real process manager so the app restarts on crash, and rotate logs so the disk never fills.

8. Health endpoints exposure
   /healthz is fine public. Consider making /readyz require a simple header token if you do not want the internet to probe gateway readiness.

9. No indexing
   Add X Robots Tag noindex on everything, especially /openclaw, /status, /setup.

10. Simple legal footer
    Two lines are enough for v1:

* “Unofficial community tool. Not affiliated with OpenClaw.”
* “Bring your own API keys. Do not connect sensitive accounts on day one.”

## Nice to have right after launch

1. A tiny “Safety Score” on Status
   Five checks, green or red. People will screenshot it.

2. Lightweight analytics
   Setup started, setup completed, gateway started, wipe triggered. No PII, no keys.

3. One shareable page
   A single page with “What it does, how it stays safe, how to wipe.” This helps virality.

If the items above are already done, you are ready to go now. If you want, paste your current production headers and session cookie config from server.js and I will sanity check the top three risks in one pass.
