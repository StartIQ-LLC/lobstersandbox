Moving fast. Here's Prompt 9 — Deploy Options Page:

PROMPT 9: Deploy Options Page
Create a new page at /deploy called "Deploy Your Sandbox."

Add a link to this page from the homepage — in the "What is LobsterSandbox?" section at the bottom, add: "🚀 Deploy your own sandbox" → /deploy. Also add it to the footer navigation.

PAGE HEADER:
Title: "🚀 Deploy Your Sandbox"
Subtitle: "Get your own LobsterSandbox instance running in minutes."
Text: "Pick the option that fits you. LobsterSandbox is the safety and guidance wrapper — you choose where it runs."

DEPLOY OPTION CARDS (stacked vertically, full width):

CARD 1 — "Replit" (PRIMARY — make this the biggest and most visually prominent)
- Recommended badge: "⭐ Recommended" in green
- Title: "Deploy on Replit"
- Subtitle: "One click. Runs in your browser. No local setup needed."
- Details row: "⏱️ ~2 minutes" · "💰 Free tier available" · "Best for: First-timers, non-technical users"
- Description: "Click the button, fork the project, and your sandbox starts automatically. Add your API key in the setup wizard and you're chatting in under 5 minutes."
- CTA: Large button "Deploy to Replit →" (link to your Replit project fork URL, or a placeholder URL for now)
- This card should be visually dominant — larger, colored border or background accent, more padding than the others

CARD 2 — "Railway"
- Title: "Deploy on Railway"
- Subtitle: "One-click cloud deploy. Your own always-on private instance."
- Details row: "⏱️ ~5 minutes" · "💰 $5/month after free trial" · "Best for: Always-on cloud instance"
- Description: "Railway handles hosting, SSL, and uptime. Your sandbox runs 24/7 on your own infrastructure."
- CTA: Button "Deploy to Railway →" (placeholder link for now)

CARD 3 — "Render"
- Title: "Deploy on Render"
- Subtitle: "Another solid one-click cloud option."
- Details row: "⏱️ ~5 minutes" · "💰 Free tier with sleep, $7/month always-on" · "Best for: Budget-conscious users"
- Description: "Render's free tier works great for testing. Upgrade to always-on when you're ready."
- CTA: Button "Deploy to Render →" (placeholder link for now)

CARD 4 — "Docker" (collapsible, starts COLLAPSED)
- Title: "Run Locally with Docker (Advanced)"
- Subtitle: "Full control on your own machine."
- Details row: "⏱️ ~15 minutes" · "💰 Free" · "Best for: Developers, privacy-focused users"
- When expanded, show:
  - "Requires Docker installed on your machine. Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL2)."
  - Code block:
    git clone https://github.com/lobstersandbox/lobstersandbox.git
    cd lobstersandbox
    docker compose up -d
  - "Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser and complete the setup wizard."
  - Note: "For Docker help, see docs.docker.com/get-docker"

SECTION BELOW THE CARDS:
Title: "What happens after you deploy?"
Numbered steps (clean, simple):
1. Open your new LobsterSandbox instance in your browser
2. Complete the setup wizard — add your API key, choose a model, set a budget
3. Read the Burner Stack Guide to set up throwaway accounts
4. Try your first Sandbox Mission
5. Explore OpenClaw through the Control UI

Reassurance text: "All safety controls — Kill Switch, Wipe, Safe Mode — are active by default from the moment you start."

DESIGN:
- Replit card should clearly dominate visually — it's the recommended path
- Other cards are clean but secondary in visual weight
- Docker card collapsed by default keeps the page clean for non-technical users
- Details rows (time, cost, best for) should be compact with subtle icons
- Consistent with site theme, nav, Larry, footer
- Mobile responsive — cards stack, all text readable
- All existing tests should pass. Add test for /deploy route.
