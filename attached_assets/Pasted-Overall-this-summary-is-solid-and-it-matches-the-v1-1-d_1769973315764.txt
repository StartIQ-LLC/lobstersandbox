Overall, this summary is solid and it matches the v1.1 direction we discussed: safe sandbox playbook first, channels second. If I were grading it as a product spec: it’s coherent, shippable, and it has the right primitives (Safe Mode, kill switch, wipe, loopback, token).

Here’s my review, with the few things I’d tighten before you show this publicly or start pushing for virality.

What looks strong
	•	Clear promise and positioning: “Try it safely without getting wrecked” is exactly what the market is asking for right now.
	•	Safe Mode enforcement is real: blocking /channels in Safe Mode is the correct call.
	•	Loopback + token + proxy is a good baseline. The gateway is not directly exposed.
	•	Kill switch + wipe being global is great. This is the emotional safety people want.
	•	The Sandbox Identity Playbook is the right approach. Guides, not auto creating accounts.

The biggest mismatch

“Autoscale (stateless)” conflicts with how the app actually works

Your app stores state in ./data and uses sessions. That is not stateless. If this ever runs across multiple instances, users will see weird behavior and data loss.

Fix: Pick one
	•	Single instance, persistent disk, simplest for now
	•	Or true stateless: move profile, logs, and session store to external storage (overkill for now)

Security gaps to fix before going viral

These are easy changes that reduce “getting wrecked” risk.
	1.	Protect logs and status
Right now /status and /api/logs are listed as public. Even with masking, logs are high risk.

Recommendation:
	•	Require auth for /status and /api/logs
	•	Or at minimum, show no logs unless logged in

	2.	Add CSRF protection on all POST routes
You have destructive endpoints like wipe and kill. Without CSRF protection, a malicious page could trigger them in a user’s browser.

Recommendation:
	•	Add CSRF tokens for POST actions
	•	Extra safety: require re entering SETUP_PASSWORD for “Wipe Everything”

	3.	Proxy boundary clarity
Even though the gateway binds to loopback, /openclaw/* is still publicly reachable through your Express app unless you enforce session auth for that route.

Recommendation:
	•	Require auth for /openclaw/*
	•	Do not pass tokens via URL
	•	Prefer server side injection of the token to the proxied UI if needed

	4.	“Tools” page is an attack surface
Web search tools can become a prompt injection highway. It is fine to have them, but they should be Power Mode only.

Recommendation:
	•	Hide /tools behind Power Mode
	•	Make it explicit: “Web tools increase risk”

	5.	Larry assistant risk
An embedded assistant is great for UX, but make sure it cannot leak secrets by accident.

Recommendation:
	•	Larry should never read env vars or raw logs
	•	If Larry references logs, only feed masked, minimal snippets

Minor spec cleanup
	•	Your “OpenClaw config paths” mention ~/.openclaw/... but you also define OPENCLAW_HOME=./data/home. Make sure the summary reflects what actually happens in this environment, otherwise people will be confused.
	•	The “Supported AI Providers” list is long and looks impressive, but it also adds cognitive load. For non technical users, I’d show only 3 options in the UI and keep the rest as “advanced.”

What I’d change in the summary itself

If you want this to read like a real product and not a dev report:
	•	Add a short “Who it’s for” section
	•	Add a “What we do not do” section:
	•	we do not create emails
	•	we do not create phone numbers
	•	we do not ask for your main accounts on day 1
	•	Move channels down as “Optional add on in Power Mode”

One sentence verdict

You’re on the right route. This spec is already the correct wedge. Fix the public logs, CSRF, and auth on /openclaw/*, and you’ll have something you can confidently push as “the safe on ramp.”

If you paste your current server.js auth logic and which routes are currently public, I’ll give you a tight checklist of exact changes to lock down the 3 risky areas: /status, /api/logs, and /openclaw/*.
