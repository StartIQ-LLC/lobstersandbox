THE 6 MISSIONS:

MISSION 1: "🌊 Hello, Lobster!"

MISSION 2: "🔍 Research Assistant"
- Difficulty: Beginner

  3. Follow up: "What are the different perspectives on this?"
  4. Try: "Find me 3 good sources about [topic] and summarize each one."
  5. Notice how it structures information and cites what it finds.
- Note box: "Web search works best with the Brave Search API skill enabled. Without it, OpenClaw uses its built-in knowledge, which is still useful but won't have the latest news."

  3. Follow up: "Make it more casual" or "Add a note about bringing agenda items"
  4. Try something different: "Write a 200-word blog post introduction about [any topic you like]."

MISSION 5: "⏰ Cron Master"

  4. Check the Cron section in the Control UI to see your scheduled task listed
  5. Wait for it to trigger (or ask OpenClaw "show me my scheduled tasks" to verify it's set up)
- Note box: "⚠️ Cron jobs use API credits each time they run. A simple daily task costs ~$0.01-0.05 per run. A job running every hour would cost ~$0.24-1.20/day. Keep an eye on your budget tracker."
- Larry: "🦞 Your agent now does things while you sleep. Welcome to the future. Just watch that budget."

MISSION 6: "🧠 Skill Builder"
- Difficulty: Intermediate
- Time: ~15 min | Cost: ~$0.25

- Steps:
  1. Open the Control UI WebChat
  2. Try: "Create a new skill called 'dice-roller' that lets me roll dice. I should be able to say 'roll 3d6' and get individual results plus a total."
  3. Test it: "Roll 2d20" — it should use the new skill
  4. Try another: "Create a skill that converts between currencies using current exchange rates."
  5. Check the Skills section in the Control UI to see your custom skills listed
  6. Skills are stored in your sandbox workspace — they're included if you Wipe.
- Note: "Custom skills are saved in the agent workspace at ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/. Browse community skills at clawhub.com for inspiration."

BOTTOM OF PAGE:
Text: "More missions coming soon! All activity stays in your sandbox — hit Wipe anytime for a fresh start."
CTA: "💡 Have an idea for a mission? Tell Larry in the chat!" (points to Larry chatbot)

DESIGN:
- Cards should feel game-like — satisfying to complete, visual progress
- Green border or glow on completed mission cards
- The step-by-step instructions should be clean and numbered, easy to follow
- Note boxes (warnings about costs, links to docs) should be visually distinct — yellow or blue info boxes
- Larry celebration messages should appear after marking each mission complete — maybe a small toast or animation
- Mobile: cards go single column, instructions still readable
- All existing tests should pass. Add a test for the /missions route.
