How to set up WhatsApp via QR scan
# WhatsApp Setup via QR Scan 📱 Great question! Here's how to get your WhatsApp channel up and running: ## Prerequisites **Before you start:** • A **separate phone number** (strongly recommended - don't use your main number!) • Best option: Old/spare Android phone + eSIM, kept on Wi-Fi and power • Or use WhatsApp Business app to keep personal WhatsApp separate ⚠️ **Avoid:** TextNow, Google Voice - WhatsApp blocks these services --- ## Step-by-Step Setup **1. Start the QR Code** • Go to the **/channels** page in LobsterSandbox • Click the **"Start WhatsApp Login"** button • A QR code will appear (check the output area on the page) **2. Scan on Your Phone** • Open WhatsApp on your spare phone • Tap **Settings** → **Linked Devices** → **Link a Device** • Point your camera at the QR code and scan it • WhatsApp will authenticate and connect **3. Choose Your Security Policy** After scanning, select a **DM Policy**: | Policy | Best For | Details | |--------|----------|---------| | **Pairing** ✅ | Security-focused | Unknown senders get an 8-char code you must approve | | **Allowlist** | Known contacts | Only specific phone numbers can chat with your bot | | **Open** | Testing | Anyone can message (use with caution!) | **4. Restart the Gateway** • Go to **/status** page • Click **"Restart Gateway"** to apply changes • Your bot is now live on WhatsApp! --- ## Configuration Options If you want to customize further (via setup): ``` dmPolicy: "pairing" # Security level allowFrom: ["+15551234567"] # Approved numbers (if using allowlist) selfChatMode: true # If using your own personal number sendReadReceipts: true # Blue ticks on/off ``` --- ## Next Steps ✅ **Test it out:** Message your bot from the linked phone number ✅ **Approve pairing:** Check **/channels** for pending requests ✅ **Monitor:** View WhatsApp activity in the **/status** logs **Need help?** If the QR code doesn't appear, make sure the gateway is running on the **/status** page! 🦞
