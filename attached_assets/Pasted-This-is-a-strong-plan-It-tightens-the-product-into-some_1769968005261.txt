This is a strong plan. It tightens the product into something people actually want right now: “safe, isolated, reversible,” without getting dragged into account creation and compliance headaches.

A few small upgrades will make it sharper and easier to ship.

## What’s great

* The pivot is right: from setup wizard to safe sandbox playbook.
* Safe Mode first is the correct default for non technical users.
* Reordering the hero is the real unlock for virality: kill switch, wipe, safe defaults.

## Two refinements I’d make

1. Make “Safe Mode” extremely concrete
   Users should instantly understand what is blocked and what is allowed. Avoid vague terms.

2. Treat “spend cap” as v1.1 guidance plus basic guardrails
   A true spend cap is hard unless you sit in the request path. For v1.1, do:

* Budget Mode copy + recommended caps
* Optional “auto stop after X hours” and “max requests per hour” as lightweight controls
* A visible warning banner if logs show high usage patterns (simple heuristic)

## v1.1 implementation task list

### Epic A: New first screen, Safety Profile Selector

1. Add route `/profile`

* Default selection: Safe Mode
* Save selection to `./data/profile.json`

2. Apply profile to behavior
   Safe Mode:

* Control UI only
* Channels UI hidden or disabled until user flips a toggle
* Force allowlist on
* Force approval gating on “send” actions where possible
* Show Kill Switch and Wipe on every page header

Power Mode:

* Channels enabled
* Still keep loopback bind + token auth + proxy only

Definition of done:

* On first visit after setup, user must pick a profile
* Profile visibly affects what the UI shows and what actions are enabled

### Epic B: Sandbox Identity Playbook inside the product

Add a new section on `/setup` and `/status` called “Sandbox Playbook” with 3 cards.

Card 1: Email separation

* Use a secondary inbox you already control
* Or create a new inbox manually
* Or use a workspace domain you own
  Copy should emphasize: do not connect your main inbox on day 1

Card 2: Phone separation

* Spare number via eSIM or second device
* WhatsApp Business with a separate number
* Keep it isolated from personal contacts early

Card 3: Billing separation

* Use a separate card with a low limit
* Start with a small monthly budget
* Use the Kill Switch if anything looks off

Definition of done:

* Playbook is visible in the product, not a README
* It feels like the product is holding the user’s hand

### Epic C: Reorder the hero and landing page

Update `/` copy and layout to focus on:

* “Try OpenClaw safely in a sandbox”
* “If it breaks, you wipe it”
* Buttons: Setup, Open Control UI, Status
* Show a small “Safety Checklist” on the home page:

  * loopback only
  * token required
  * kill switch
  * wipe and reset

Definition of done:

* Channels are not mentioned on the landing page above the fold

### Epic D: Make Kill Switch and Wipe always reachable

1. Add a persistent top bar on every page:

* Status
* Kill Switch
* Wipe Everything (confirm dialog)

2. Wipe behavior

* Stop gateway
* Reset OpenClaw state
* Delete local app state in `./data`
* Return user to `/profile`

Definition of done:

* User can always stop and wipe within one click from any screen

### Epic E: “Remote access hardening” as a later layer, but add the placeholder now

Add a section “Remote Access (optional)” with two choices:

* Recommended: Tailscale (safe defaults)
* Advanced: Cloudflare Tunnel + Access

For v1.1, this can be guidance plus a checklist. You can automate later.

Definition of done:

* Users are explicitly warned not to open ports directly

## Exact screen flow

1. `/` Landing
2. `/setup` Login
3. `/setup` Wizard runs
4. `/profile` Choose Safe Mode or Power Mode
5. `/status` Verify, playbook, audit buttons
6. `/openclaw` Control UI

## Suggested copy (tight and non technical)

Landing headline:
LobsterSandbox

Subheadline:
Run OpenClaw in a safe sandbox. Safe Mode by default, kill switch included.

Buttons:

* Start Setup
* Open Control UI
* View Status

Safe Mode card text:
Best for first time users. Keeps things isolated and reversible.

Power Mode card text:
For experienced users. Enables channels, still keeps secure defaults.

## Final opinion

Yes, this is the right route. It answers the exact fear in the market: “I want to join the party without getting wrecked.” Your product becomes the default safe on ramp.

If you want, paste your current route list and file structure from Replit and I’ll map this v1.1 plan into a checklist of exact edits per file, including the specific UI sections to add where.
