What looks great

Safety Profile Selector done and persisted

Safe Mode hides channels until intentional enable

Kill switch and wipe everywhere (typed WIPE + password is strong)

Playbook inside the app and persisted

/healthz and /readyz added

CSRF with friendly error page for human flows plus JSON for API clients

Tests expanded

What I would double check before you ship publicly

Gate /openclaw behind the same login session as /setup
Even with gateway token auth, you do not want a public URL where anyone can hit the proxied UI. Make sure access to /openclaw requires the setup session.

/readyz must be fast and safe under load
If /readyz runs an expensive CLI check every request, it can become a mini DoS vector. Ideal pattern:

use a lightweight connectivity check (TCP connect or a fast HTTP ping to loopback)

add a short timeout (ex: 300 to 800 ms)

cache the result for 2 to 5 seconds

Secrets masking must cover error paths
Make sure you never log full command strings that include keys, and that stack traces and proxy logs do not include env vars.

Tailwind: what to do next

You have two realistic options:

Option A (fine for MVP): keep Play CDN, but be honest

In docs and UI, say “MVP uses Tailwind Play CDN for speed”

Add a CSP that only allows the specific CDN you use

Accept the console warning

This is acceptable for a viral MVP, but it is not “production hardened” per Tailwind’s own guidance.

Option B (recommended for production): compile a static CSS file

This removes runtime JS, removes the warning, and gives you deterministic styling.

Minimal approach using Tailwind CLI:

npm i -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init


Create an input file (example: styles/input.css):

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;


Build CSS:

npx tailwindcss -i ./styles/input.css -o ./public/tailwind.css --minify --content "./views/**/*.html,./lib/**/*.js,./server.js"


Then replace the Play CDN script with:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/tailwind.css">


That is the clean “real production” step.

How I would update your release note wording

Change:

“The app is production-ready as-is”

To:

“The app is launch-ready for MVP. Tailwind is currently using the Play CDN for speed; we can switch to compiled CSS when we want full production hardening.”

Quick ship checklist

Confirm /openclaw requires login

Confirm /readyz is fast with a timeout and small cache

Confirm no secrets in logs, error pages, proxy headers

Post the “Safe Mode by default” message everywhere

If you paste your route list (just the endpoints) and which routes are protected by the setup session today, I’ll tell you immediately if there is any exposure risk.
