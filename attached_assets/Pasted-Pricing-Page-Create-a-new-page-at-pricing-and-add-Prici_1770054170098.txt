Pricing Page

FAQ SECTION below the pricing cards (collapsible accordion style):

Q: "Is OpenClaw itself free?"
A: "Yes! OpenClaw is open source and always free. LobsterSandbox adds the safety layer, guided setup, cost tracking, and managed experience on top."

Q: "What about AI model costs?"
A: "AI model costs (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, etc.) are separate and paid directly to your provider. LobsterSandbox helps you set spending limits and track costs so there are no surprises. Testing with Claude Haiku or GPT-4o-mini typically costs a few cents per session."

Q: "Can I self-host LobsterSandbox?"
A: "LobsterSandbox is open source. You can fork it and run it yourself for free. Paid plans add managed hosting, cost tracking, automatic updates, and support."

Q: "What happens when I outgrow the sandbox?"
A: "We help you graduate! Pro users can export their sandbox config and follow our migration guide to set up a full OpenClaw instance on their own hardware or cloud provider."

Q: "Can I change or cancel my plan?"
A: "Upgrade, downgrade, or cancel anytime. Your sandbox stays accessible. If you cancel a paid plan, you keep Explorer-tier features."

Q: "Is my data safe?"
A: "Your sandbox data stays on your instance. We don't have access to your AI conversations, API keys, or connected accounts. That's the whole point."

DESIGN:
- The Pro card should clearly stand out as the recommended option — use visual hierarchy (larger, border, shadow, or background tint)
- Checkmarks should be green, the ⬜ for branding limitation should be a muted gray empty box
- Price numbers should be large and bold
- FAQ answers should be hidden by default, expand on click with smooth animation
- Consistent with site theme, nav bar, Larry chatbot, footer
- Mobile: cards stack vertically, Pro card still visually prominent
- All existing tests should pass. Add a test for /pricing route.
